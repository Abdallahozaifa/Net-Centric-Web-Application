  # Working on 
    * Create another folder called “Schedule” to hold all the files related to this function
    * Add a link in the navigation bar. When this link is clicked, myschedule.html is loaded into the content frame.
    * The file myschedule.html should load the side.html located in the Schedule folder (It may simply show “the schedule is subject        to changes”). 
    * Create Injection Function that injects data received from the server into the table.

    * The file myschedule.html should have an empty body. Upon load complete, the client-side script should use jQuery to 
      a.	Generate a table for the schedule
      b.	Request the server for the array containing the schedule information, 
      c.	Populate the table with appropriate information based on the response from the server.
      d.	Use CSS to style the table elements, exactly as in the pdf file.
